# Overview

A minimal, JSON-driven dialogue plugin for Phaser 3 that supports visual novel–style text, typewriter effects, branching choices, nameplate coloring, and external logic control — all driven by a single JSON structure.


# Features

- 🧾 JSON-based dialogue scripting
- 💬 Character nameplates with color tags
- 🧠 Label-based branching via `jump`
- 🎭 Player choices
- ⏳ Typewriter text effect
- 🎨 Simple inline styling with `{style=value}`
- 🧰 Global config for fonts, box style, and speed
- 🔌 Exposed API for `jumpTo`, `pause`, and hooks
- 🔊 Inline audio triggers with `{audio=value}{/audio}` tags



# Installation

```bash
npm install @robingamedev/visual-novel-dialogue
```

# Code

- `.cursor/usage.mdc` for the code pattern of how to set up, the api, and methods
- `.cursor/json-format.mdc` for the code pattern for the json file, and commands

The plugin includes built-in support for parser commands like `show`, `hide`, `jump`, and `end`.  
These commands are automatically interpreted and handled by the plugin — no extra setup is required to make them work.


# Plugin Architecture

This plugin is implemented as a **Scene Plugin**, meaning it attaches to a specific scene and renders UI directly on that scene’s display list. This ensures full control over layout, layering, and lifecycle.

The dialogue box is rendered in a **fixed position**, typically near the bottom of the screen. Developers can reposition it manually or configure the layout through the plugin config.

Rendering is handled using **custom Phaser UI elements**, not the DOM or third-party UI layers. This keeps it performant and canvas-native.

Commands like `show` and `hide` also emit events (`onShow`, `onHide`) so you can hook into character sprite logic without tightly coupling it to the dialogue system.

# What This Plugin Does **Not** Do

To keep things modular and extensible, this plugin does **not** include:
- Conditional branching or logic evaluation
- Save/load system or rollback
- Sprite/image rendering
- i18n or localization support
- Multiple dialogue file handling (you must unload the current one first)
- Saving/resuming active dialogue mid-sequence  
  (Save game state **before** or **after** the interaction, not during)
- Only one dialogue box is supported per scene — multi-character UIs are out of scope

All external logic should be handled in your Phaser scene or game systems.
